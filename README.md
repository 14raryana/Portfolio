# Portfolio
Homework 2

A rough draft of the final portfolio we will be making by the end of this class.

## index
basically the table of contents page of the portfolio site.  animated button along with some minor animation with the color of the name.  Nav bar is directly under the name. footer at bottom

## about
this page is a brief description about me, along with a picture.  I have also added my Resumé because I figured it would be good to have on there.  a little bit of javascript to make the resumé actually appear.  navbar located in the top right and shrinks down in size with window.  picture goes to full opacity when hovered over. footer at bottom

## portfolio page
did not have much to put on this page since we are just starting out. Just listed some things that we have been learning with a carousel which has next and previous buttons.  footer at bottom

## contact 
a contact me page.  Unfortunately the form is non functional since we have not learned how to make a functional form yet. But i will add it in as soon as we do learn it.  every field of the form is required in order to submit, except for the comments.  user has option of whether or not they want to type in their email by using the checkbox.  footer at bottom.

## footer
arguably the hardest part of this entire assignment.  Took me a decent bit of time to actually figure out how to keep it at the bottom of the page.  It has 3 buttons to the right of it that you can hover over for a little animation in color.  the links go the the respective websites.  However, I only have a github account so only the github button will take you to my account.  the other two just take you to the front pages of the websites.
